        <h1>Man's Best Friend - Dog</h1>

        <img src="/Images/dog-1742295_1280 Image by Linda.jpg" alt=""></img>

        <p>The dog or domestic dog (<i class="binomial">Canis familiaris</i> or <i class="binomial">Canis lupus familiaris</i>) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other <i>canids</i>.</p>
        
        <p> The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">Dog breeds</a> vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. <em>This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend"</em>.</p>

        <h2>Domestication</h2>

        <img src="/Images/632px-Siberian_Husky_pho.jpg" alt="">Siberian Huskies are pack animals that still enjoy some human companionship</img>

        <p>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in <b class="person">Bonn-Oberkassel</b>, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of <i class="condition">canine distemper</i>. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as <i>Paleolithic dogs</i>, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the <i class="period">Late Pleistocene</i>.</p>

        <p>This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of hunter-gatherers, which predates agriculture. DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">modern wolf</a> lineage. Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago. This indicates that an extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.</p>
            
        <p>The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.</p>

        <h2><a id="">Breeds</a></h2>

        <p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. In the <i class="period">Victorian era</i> directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. As a result, present day dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the <i class="period">Victorian era</i></p>

        <h2>Anatomy</h2>

        <h3>Skeleton</h3>

        <img src="/Images/726px-Dog_anatomy_lateral_skeleton_view.jpg" alt="A lateral view of a dog skeleton"><i class="caption">A lateral view of a dog skeleton.</i></img>

        <p>All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great flexibility.</p>

        <P>Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.</P>
            
        <P>The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types. The three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.</p>
        
        <h3>Senses</h3>
        <p>A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field. <em>Another study has suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field</em>.</p>

        <h3>Coat</h3>

        <img src="/Images/Dog_coat_variation.png" alt=""><i class="caption">Dogs display wide variation in coat type, density, length, color, and composition.</i></img>

        <p>The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.</p>
        
        <h3>Tail</h3>
        <p>There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.</p>

        <h2>Health</h2>

        <p>Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as <i class="disease">elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees</i> Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are <i class="disease">pyometra</i> affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and <i class="disease">Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat)</i> which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as <i class="disease">fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms</i> which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.</p>

        <p>Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids, causing <i class="condition">theobromine poisoning</i> onions and garlic, causing <i class="condition">thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning</i> grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol. The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include <i class="symptoms">copious vomiting</i> (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or <i class="symptoms">diarrhea</i> Some other symptoms are <i class="symptoms">abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death</i></p>
            
        <p><em>Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including <i class="conditon">diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis</i></em>.</p>

        <h3>Life Span</h3>
        <p>The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) ranges from 10 to 13 years. The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged. <em>For dogs in England, increased body weight has been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan)</em>, <strong>and mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>

        <img src="/Images/A female dog nursing newborn puppies.JPG" alt="A female dog nursing newborn puppies."><i class="caption">A female dog nursing newborn puppies.</i></img>

        <p>In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.</p>

        <p>Fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation; 14-16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable.</p>
            
        <p>Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies.</p>

        <h3>Neutering</h3>
        <p>Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the <b class="organization">American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)</b> advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized.</P>

        <P>According to the Humane Society of the United States, three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized each year. Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.</P>
            
        <p>Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers affecting the mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs and prostate cancer in males and <i class="condition">osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus</i> in either sex.</p>

        <h2>Behaviour</h2>
        <p>Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.</p>

        <p>Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.</p>

        <h3>Intellingence</h3>
        <p>Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with <b class="name">Rico</b>, a <i class="breed">Border Collie</i> showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another <i class="breed">Border Collie</i>, <b class="name">Chaser</b> documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. <em>Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands</em>.</p>

        <p>One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. <em>One limited study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focussed on the "what" of a task rather than the "where"</em>.</p>
            
        <p>Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that <i class="breed">Australian dingos</i> can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.[69] Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.</p>

        <h3>Commuication</h3>

        <audio src="/Images/A_dog_making_noises_and_barking.flac" controls><i class="caption">A dog making noises and barking.</i></audio>
        
        <p>Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans and translate the information that dogs are transmitting. Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture.</p>
